In order to run the file 
1.Run the flask file main.py which will generate data
2.Run the log.py locally to generate the logs
3.Run the queryLogs.py by giving required query fields 
##-- the ui interface is also available but there was an issue with filtering the values directly with ui
Currently i have included the logs i.e., log1.log ---
you are free to delete them and run the log.py to get the logs
